# Chapter 10: Advanced AI Collaboration Patterns - Code Snippets

## Chat-based AI Assistant: Single Interaction

```markdown
# Chat-based AI assistant: Single interaction
prompt: "Generate user authentication system"
response: Code snippet for login component
```

## Workflow-based AI: Multi-step with Predefined Sequence

```markdown
# Workflow-based AI: Multi-step with predefined sequence
User prompt: "Generate a complete user authentication system"

Internal workflow execution:
 - Step 1: Analyze project structure
 - Step 2: Create user model with schema
 - Step 3: Generate authentication controller
 - Step 4: Add login/logout routes
 - Step 5: Generate basic integration tests
```

## Autonomous Agent: Dynamic Planning and Execution

```markdown
# Autonomous agent: Dynamic planning and execution
prompt: "Implement secure user authentication"

agent_process:
 - Analyzes existing codebase architecture
 - Discovers: Express.js backend with MongoDB
 - Decides: Use JWT tokens + bcrypt for passwords
 - Plans database changes: adds User schema with password hashing
 - Implements changes across 7 files
 - Runs tests, detects integration issue
 - Self-corrects: Adjusts middleware authentication flow
 - Validates: All tests passing, security audit clean
```
